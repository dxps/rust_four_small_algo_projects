## Milestone 1: GCD and LCM

In this milestone, the goal is to implement:

-   the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers
    -   using _Euclidean algoright_
    -   [reference](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/the-euclidean-algorithm)
-   the lowest common multiple (LCD) of two numbers

### Usage

Use the standard `cargo run`.

An execution example looks like this:

```
Enter two positive integers (named below as A and B) to calculate the GCD and LCM of them.
Enter A: 55290
Enter B: 115430
-----------------------------------------
       A       B    GCD(A,B)    LCM(A,B)
   55290  115430         970     6579510
-----------------------------------------
```

<br/>

#### Tests

This includes some unit tests, so `cargo test` runs them and the test results should report `ok`.
